# Optimising-land-use-classification-with-satellite-images
Classifying satellite images plays an important role in remote sensing
as it allows for the categorization of land cover and land use. It
entails categorising each pixel in an image into a particular class or
category according to its spectral properties. Satellite imagery
classification is widely used in environmental monitoring, urban
planning, agriculture, and disaster management. Conventional
techniques for classifying satellite images often depend on manually
designed features, which may be labour-intensive and less efficient
in intricate situations. Deep learning provides a possible alternative
through the autonomous acquisition of hierarchical representations
from unprocessed data. This thesis seeks to investigate the capacity
of deep learning methods, specifically convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), to extract significant features from satellite images to
achieve precise classification. The work will also cover challenges
such as data scarcity, class imbalance, and domain adaption that I
will be working to overcome to progress in the subject.

**Dataset Information**:
The dataset consists of 27,000 geo-referenced images categorised
into 10 Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes. It incorporates 13
spectral bands, aiming to leverage advanced deep learning and
image processing methods for enhanced classification. This
comprehensive dataset facilitates exploration into optimising the
classification process, offering ample opportunities for refining
techniques and algorithms in satellite image analysis within the
context of land use and land cover classification.

**Research Questions**:
How do various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures
impact the accuracy of land use classification in European
satellite images?
What is the comparative effectiveness of different CNN
variations in handling diverse land features and terrain
complexities present in European landscapes?

**Methodology**
The methodology encompasses several key steps. Initially, a high-
resolution satellite image dataset was gathered. Pre-processing involved
resizing images to 150x150 for standardisation. Utilising convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), diverse variations were employed for feature
extraction and subsequent land use classification. Evaluation of model
performance centred on accuracy metrics, with iterative refinement to
enhance classification accuracy. This iterative process ensures the
model's adaptability across various geographical contexts.
